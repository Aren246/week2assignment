 Reflection 

When I worked on my image gallery project, I learned a lot about building and designing webpages. At first, I thought it would be easy, but I faced some challenges along the way. One (of many) problem I found difficult was making the gallery look good on different screen sizes. On the computer it looked fine, but on a phone the images didn’t fit properly. To solve this, I looked up how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox. After trying a few things, I used Grid, and it made the gallery adjust by itself depending on the screen. However, the images still change size a little when switching between mobile view and desktop. Even though it’s not perfect, it works much better than before. Making the gallery responsive and user friendly was harder than I expected and some of the requirements may not have been fully met. This is one problem I was unable to rectify. What I seem to do looking back is drift away from the example and enter a blackhole of endless videos and tutorials making it more difficult for myself and seem to end up at a deadend, staring at the screen for a while! One thing I definitley learned is, that the more I tried to fiddle with it the more problems popped up. But there were some useful resources including tiktok videos, youtube shorts, and ws3shool, once again proved to be a very helpful website. Looking back at the coding, it looks very simple and makes me wonder why on earth it took almost 3 days to complete!
